# Hotel_Data_Analytics
In this project, I conducted an in-depth data analysis for a hotel chain. I began by thoroughly understanding the core business challenge and then leveraged a Kaggle dataset. My work encompassed data cleaning, transforming the dataset, and extracting valuable insights to provide a comprehensive understanding of the hotel chain's data.
